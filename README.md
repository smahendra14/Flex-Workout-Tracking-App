# Flex: Workout Tracker
A mobile app that allows users to keep track of their progress in the gym by logging their workouts. 

# Frontend 
The frontend of the app was built using React Native CLI. React Navigation's Stack Navigator was used to allow users to move between different screens of the app. Formik and Yup schema validation were used to ensure user's were properly inputting their workout information when prompted. 

# Backend
The backend of the app is built with Firebase. The Firestore database was used to store a user's workouts and saves the workouts logged based on the current day. This allows users to access their workouts from previous days to see their progress over time.
